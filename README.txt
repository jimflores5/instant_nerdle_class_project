Many students are/were into the Wordle fad, but one adaptation of this
game is Nerdle. This works just like Wordle, but players must identify
the correct order for numbers and mathematical operators (+-*/).

An adaptation to the adaptation is Instant Nerdle 
(https://instant.nerdlegame.com/). Here, players know all the numbers
and operators, but not the correct order. Also, only 1 guess is allowed.

Instant Nerdle is a great example of algorithmic thinking! This would be
a great culminating project to give to your coding class.

Have your students brainstorm ideas about what steps need to be taken,
the order of execution, how to collect user input, etc.

Note: Python has an `eval()` function that can be used to evaluate an
equation entered as a string ('2 + 3 * 5'). However, spend time in class
emphasizing why using `eval()` is a BAD idea in terms of security.
